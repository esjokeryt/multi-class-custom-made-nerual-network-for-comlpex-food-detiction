# multi-class-custom-made-nerual-network-for-comlpex-food-detiction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the "S-2025 Multi-Class Neural Network Assignment 6" competition on Kaggle. The notebook implements a multi-class classification neural network using Keras and TensorFlow. The code handles data loading, preprocessing (label encoding and one-hot encoding), and prepares the data for training and validation. The notebook is designed to train, evaluate, and test the model for the competition.

Getting Started
To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:

tensorflow

keras

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

Usage
Clone this repository: git clone [repository_url]

Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/s-2025-multi-class-neural-network-assignment-6

Place the dataset files in the correct directory as referenced in the notebook (/kaggle/input/ass6-dataset/ in the original notebook).

Open the assignment-6.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment.

Run the cells to train the model and see the results.
